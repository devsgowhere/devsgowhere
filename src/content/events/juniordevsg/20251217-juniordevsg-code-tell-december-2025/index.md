**Presentations**

**Topic: What I Learned Building a Tech Startup (Without Being a Developer)**

**Speaker:**
Nino Mouton, Founder, CEO of Playbook Technologies Pte Ltd
LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nino-mouton-playbook/

**Description**
Starting a tech company when you can’t write a single line of code sounds like a recipe for disaster, but it became my crash course in building products, teams, and ideas that work. In this 30-minute talk, I’ll share the real story behind launching a startup in Singapore’s tech scene: the wins, the mistakes, and the surprising lessons along the way. From learning to speak “developer” to understanding the power of soft skills, this is a founder’s perspective on what it really takes to turn ideas into impact, without ever touching the code.

**About Nino**
Yustiniani Mouton is the founder and CEO of Playbook, an AI-powered talent development platform that builds standardised learning and assessment systems for soft skills, essentially a “TOEFL for soft skills.” Playbook tackles the critical skills gap that prevents many Indonesian graduates from thriving in today’s workplace.
An edutech entrepreneur with more than 20 years of experience in technology, media, and education, Yustiniani brings global insight to solving local challenges. She previously served as Editor-in-Chief of Cosmopolitan Indonesia and has worked with international institutions such as Centre Pompidou Paris and UNESCO.
She holds a Master’s degree from Université de Lorraine, France, and graduated cum laude from Gadjah Mada University, Indonesia. As a published author, she has written career development books and fiction for Indonesian readers. Her entrepreneurial ventures also include digital media and education marketplace.

**Topic: JuniorDevSG Lean Coffee Discussion**

**Speaker:**
Michael Cheng, Founder, JuniorDevSG
https://www.linkedin.com/in/miccheng/

**Description**
Lean Coffee is a structured, yet agenda-less, meeting format where participants democratically build the agenda on the spot. It combines a "lean" approach to minimize wasted time with a casual "coffee" atmosphere, resulting in focused and productive discussions. Topics are proposed, voted on, and discussed within timeboxes, which is especially popular with Agile teams.

**NO FOOD PROVIDED FOR THIS MEETUP**

We will be doing the Coding Dojo this week.

Do you know what a Coding Dojo is?

> A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge. They are there to have fun and to engage in Deliberate Practice in order to improve their skills.

The focus of the Coding Dojo would be to help you improve your skills in the language you are working on (or ramping up on). We also hope that pair-programming with more experienced devs will help you level up.

Format wise, the team will be given a Code Kata (a coding puzzle) where they have to solve by writing code. And through pair-programming, they will learn about writing test (TDD) and using advanced coding techniques from the more experienced devs in your group.

What is a Code Kata?

A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each.

You need to try it as many times as it takes, and be comfortable making mistakes. You need to look for feedback each time so you can work to improve.

Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at a correct answer. The point is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the solution.

What do i need to bring?

You will be coding - so bring your laptop and make sure you have all your coding tools and dev environment installed.

I suggest bringing along your own keyboard and mouse so that you can connect to your pair-programming partner's laptop.

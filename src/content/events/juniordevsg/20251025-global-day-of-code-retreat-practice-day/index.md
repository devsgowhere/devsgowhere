\======================  
_**\*\*NO FOOD PROVIDED FOR THIS MEETUP\*\***_

We will be doing the Code Retreat this week.  
Coderetreats are free day-long, intensive practice events, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of "getting things done", the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of learning and nurturing software development skills.

Format wise, the team will be given a Code Kata (a coding puzzle) where they have to solve by writing code. And through pair-programming, they will learn about writing test (TDD) and using advanced coding techniques from the more experienced devs in your group.

\======================  
**What is a Code Kata?**

A kata is an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in each.

You need to try it as many times as it takes, and be comfortable making mistakes. You need to look for feedback each time so you can work to improve.

Remember that the point of the kata is not arriving at a correct answer. The point is the stuff you learn along the way. The goal is the practice, not the solution.

\======================  
**Agenda:**

10:00am - Intro to Coding Dojo / Code Kata  
10:15am - Reveal Code Kata for the day  
10:20am - Pair up and attempt Code Kata (pairs can choose their own choice of programming language)  
11:30am - Break  
11:45pm - Continue Code Kata  
12:30pm - Show and Tell

\======================  
**What do i need to bring?**

You will be coding - so bring your laptop and make sure you have all your coding tools and dev environment installed.

I suggest bringing along your own keyboard and mouse so that you can connect to your pair-programming partner's laptop.

**Presentations**

**Topic: How I build a Homelab with Kubernetes**

**Speaker:**  
Sharon Woo, Software Engineer  
LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-woo/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharon-woo/)

**Description**  
Ever thought about running your own cloud at home? In this talk, I’ll share how I built a self-hosted home lab to block ads network-wide, centralize my media servers, and save costs versus commercial cloud services. Using Proxmox and TrueNAS Scale as the foundation, I’ve built a setup that’s flexible, quiet, and surprisingly efficient.

On top of that, I’m running Kubernetes (k3s) for orchestration, Tailscale for secure networking, and self-hosted tools like AdGuard Home, Forgejo, Grafana, Jellyfin, Immich, and Home Assistant. It’s part learning lab, part smart home (with some dumb moments), and a fun way to take control of my digital world.

**About Sharon**  
Software engineer with a data background, but we’re here to talk about HOMELABS. Yes, I somehow accidentally fell into managing EKS deployments. No, I can’t explain how it happened. Yes, my spouse has questions.

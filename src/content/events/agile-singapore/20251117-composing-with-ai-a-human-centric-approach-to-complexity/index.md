## Overview

Dive into the world of creativity and AI, and explore how to compose with a human touch in a complex environment.

**“Don’t command the machine. Compose with it.”**

In an age where AI is expected to answer everything, we invite you to slow down, step back, and ask better questions.

Join us for a thought-provoking and experiential evening where complexity theory, polarity thinking, and sensemaking frameworks meet the practical realities of AI tools such as ChatGPT.

Light refreshments will be provided, courtesy of Titansoft.

## 🧠 What this session offers:

- A deeper understanding of complexity and polarity management — not just as theory, but as practical tools to navigate modern systems, people, and machines.
- How AI is coded for order, and why this can be dangerous in uncertain or emergent situations.
- How to discern what you are really asking of AI, and how to set better prompts, contexts, and ethical boundaries.
- Clear guidelines to avoid hallucinations and misapplications, especially in high-stakes or people-sensitive situations.
- A practical map of when and how to use AI based on the nature of the system you are in — from automation to emergence.
- Help developers design AI-assisted workflows and prompts that adapt to the complexity of real-world software systems — balancing automation with human discernment.


## 🛠️ Activities

- System complexity mapping — showing when automation is appropriate vs. when human interpretation is required.
- Team decision-making simulation — how AI recommendations can bias choices in code reviews or design discussions.


## 🎯 By the end of the evening, you will leave with:

- New perspectives for assessing complexity and AI’s appropriateness
- Methods to improve your skills in prompting, reflection, and discernment
- Ideas to bring ethical, human-centred AI practices back to your team or organisation
- Practices to strengthen your own thinking, rather than outsource it


## 🧭 Who is this for?

- Curious technologists, facilitators, and designers
- Team leads, developers, coaches, consultants, and AI explorers
- Anyone who wants to think with AI, not just use it

**About this Meetup**  
Every modernisation journey has its pitfalls. In this STACK Meetup, discover how the GovTech team supporting HDB, Singapore's public housing agency, overcame challenges to modernise systems and support increased citizen demand.

Deep dive into what really drives change beyond just tech upgrades. Learn about the real lessons the team has picked up along the way. Avoid the usual pitfalls and make smarter moves by understanding how tech, people, and value underpin modernisation.

This session will also spotlight HDB Contact Centre's successful modernisation through GatherSG, a Whole-of-Government solution. Hear about what worked (and what didn't!), how the team dealt with changing needs agilely, and the impact of value delivered to citizens.

If you're leading or part of a dev team considering modernisation, this is a great chance to get practical insights and fresh ideas from folks who've been in the trenches!

Join us today. Seats are limited so **[sign up](https://go.gov.sg/stackmeetup-16oct2025-reg)** now!

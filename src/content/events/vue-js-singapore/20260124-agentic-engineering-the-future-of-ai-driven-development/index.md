With the rise of AI, software and application development is changing fast. Today, it’s less about whether you code in Vue, React, or another framework—it’s about **how you leverage AI-driven development** and which languages and frameworks work best with LLMs.

At this meetup, we’ll explore how AI is transforming software development. Even if you focus solely on frontend, you’ll discover new approaches and practices that can reshape the way you build applications.
Join us to discuss **Agentic Engineering** and the new horizons AI opens for developers!

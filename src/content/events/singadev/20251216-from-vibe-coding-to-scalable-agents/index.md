# **Topic 1**

**Trials and Tribulations of Vibe Coding and Context Engineering**

# **Abstract**

In this talk Chris share his experiences with vibe coding & context engineering (a) a UI given a live API (b) API tests for the API (c) synthetic monitors for the API using Checkly (d) functional tests (Playwright) using a mocked API and live API. In this talk, Chris shares some of the tools he has been test-driving that could make UI/functional tests much easier and that groks well with the AI-assisted coding workflow.

# **Speaker Bio**

Heemeng (Chris) Foo is a Certified AI Engineer and seasoned technology leader with over two decades of experience at the intersection of software quality, systems engineering, and emerging AI. He has built and led global quality and engineering teams across SaaS, fintech, legaltech, agritech and digital media organizations—including Rocket Lawyer, Finix, The Climate Corporation, and Yahoo—embedding automation, compliance, and scale into some of the world’s most demanding platforms. A frequent advisor to startups and scale-ups, Heemeng helps organizations look at software quality not just as a test function but about engineering excellence. His talks invite audiences to reimagine quality, not as a checkpoint, but as the living fabric of how we build intelligent systems that matter.

# **Topic 2**

**AI Driven Development**
**(Scaling todays AI Solutions to match your pace)**

# **Abstract**

This talk introduces the next evolution of software engineering. We will move beyond the prompt to explore **Agents**, a structured methodology where developers orchestrate specialized AI agents (Analysts, Architects, and Coders) using rigorous "Story Files" rather than loose chats. Learn how to ditch the chaos of infinite context, eliminate circular debugging, and transform AI from a junior assistant into a reliable engineering partner.

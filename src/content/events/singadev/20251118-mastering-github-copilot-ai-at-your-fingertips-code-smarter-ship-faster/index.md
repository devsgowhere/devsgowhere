​AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot can supercharge productivity — but only if you know how to use them right. This session explores practical ways developers can utilize Copilot to write cleaner, faster, and smarter code — without compromising control over logic, security, or creativity.

​We’ll cover:

​1.⁠ ⁠How to prompt Copilot effectively (and what not to do)

​2.⁠ ⁠Real-world examples of speeding up debugging and refactoring

​3.⁠ ⁠Balancing automation with craftsmanship

​4.⁠ ⁠Common pitfalls and how to avoid “lazy coding” traps

​Whether you’re a junior dev curious about AI tools or a senior engineer exploring workflow optimization, this hands-on session will help you level up your development speed and code quality.

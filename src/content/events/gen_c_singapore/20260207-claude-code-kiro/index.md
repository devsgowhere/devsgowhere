**Below is the schedule,**

🧱 **10.30am - 11.10am : Topic - Topic - Claude Code for Beginners: Build & Deploy Your First App to Cloud in 60 Minutes**

This beginner-friendly session introduces Claude Code as your AI pair-programmer and shows how anyone can build and deploy a real web application — even with no prior coding experience. We’ll start from a blank folder, use natural language prompts to create a simple web app, run it locally, and deploy it to Cloud so it’s live on the internet. Along the way, you’ll learn how to ask Claude the right questions, understand what the code is doing in plain English, and fix common mistakes without fear. By the end, you’ll walk away knowing how AI can lower the barrier to building software — and with a live app you can proudly share.

11.10am - 11.30am : Q&A session

🤖 **11.30am - 12.10pm : Topic - KIRO: Structured requirements + Property Based Testing = Provable Correctness**

Passing tests and green checkmarks can still be misleading. Traditional testing only shows that code works for the specific scenarios we thought to check, limited by time constraints, misunderstood requirements, and unconscious assumptions. This programme explores Property-Based Testing in Spec-Driven Development using Kiro. It examines selection bias in testing, automated generation of thousands of test cases, and how structured requirements enable machine reasoning for building correct software.

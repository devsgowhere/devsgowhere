**Below is the schedule,**

🧱 **10.30am - 11.10am : Topic - Vision-Language Models: Bridging the Gap Between Images and Words**

This presentation introduces the fascinating world of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) - AI systems that combine visual and linguistic understanding. We will cover how these models process images and text through shared representations, explore notable examples including CLIP, BLIP-2, and GPT-4V, and discuss their growing role in accessibility, education, creative design, and autonomous systems. Participants will gain a solid understanding of how VLMs work, their real-world applications, and the opportunities and challenges ahead in multimodal AI.

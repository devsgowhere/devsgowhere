Career Series: Talk & Tackle is a dynamic initiative designed to elevate the professional development of cybersecurity practitioners. This series will feature a combination of hands-on workshops and interactive Q&A sessions, providing an engaging platform for experienced professionals to tackle pressing technical challenges in real-time.

Each quarter, Talk & Tackle will focus on four distinct themes:

Red Team: Participants will explore offensive security tactics, learning how to think like an attacker. Workshops will cover topics such as penetration testing methodologies, social engineering techniques, and the latest tools used in red teaming, equipping attendees with the skills to anticipate and counteract threats.
Blue Team: This theme will delve into defensive strategies, emphasizing threat detection, incident response, and risk management. Attendees will engage in simulations and case studies that allow them to practice and refine their skills in protecting networks and systems against various cyber threats.
White/Yellow/Green Team: These sessions will foster collaboration between offensive and defensive teams. We’ll address best practices in threat intelligence sharing, security policy development, and compliance measures. This integrated approach will highlight the importance of a cohesive cybersecurity strategy across different teams.
Emerging Technologies: As technology rapidly evolves, this theme will focus on the latest advancements in cybersecurity, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain security. Participants will gain insights into how these technologies are reshaping the cybersecurity landscape and explore practical applications to enhance their own security practices.

**ABOUT THE RANGE VILLAGE**
​The Range Village is a community driven cyber range interest group aimed to provide community curated Cyber Range content for people who are interested in practicing their cyber skills such as active directory testing, lateral movements, defence evasion, and provisioning of an attack infrastructure. We live in a world where cybersecurity education is within a Google search or a GenAI prompt, but the access to a certain range or resource to practice those skills can be costly to individuals who are not in the position to self-fund a paid cyber range or premium access range.

**ABSTRACT**
The Range Villages brings back the classic cloud security workshop, where participants can get hands on with modern cloud security risks and techniques used.

**SET UP INSTRUCTIONS FOR PARTICIPANTS**
Participants will need to bring their own laptop with a Kali Linux virtual machine

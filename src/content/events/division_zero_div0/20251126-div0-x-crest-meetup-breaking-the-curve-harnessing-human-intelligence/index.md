**ABSTRACT**
**y² = x³ + 7 (Breaking the Curve)**
The odds of breaking an Ethereum private key based on an ECC curve within a 256bit field are roughly 1 in 115 quattuorvigintillion (115 and 75 zeros). In theory there is a higher chance I cure cancer, the world explodes, and aliens land on earth. These incredible odds are my starting point, armed with an attitude of “nothing is really impossible, only incredibly difficult” I set on the task of guessing a private key to find real cryptocurrency money using only creativity, curiosity, and a positive hacker attitude. Was I successful? Come see my talk and find out.

**Hacker-Focused Penetration Testing: Harnessing Human Intelligence in the Age of AI**
In this session, I’ll share how a *hacker-focused mindset* has shaped my approach to penetration testing — moving beyond automated scans and compliance checks to real-world attack simulations that uncover impactful vulnerabilities.

I’ll walk you through some of my notable findings, including the **[Meta.AI prompt leak](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/15/meta-fixes-bug-that-could-leak-users-ai-prompts-and-generated-content/)**, a **[WeWork data exposure](https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/04/wework-exposed-visitors-data/)**, and a **Zomato blind XSS that escalated from a mobile app to the admin portal**, to illustrate how thinking like an attacker reveals what traditional testing often misses.
I’ll also discuss how I apply **red-team scenarios**, **offensive research techniques**, and **attacker psychology** to identify critical security vulnerabilities and secure modern tech companies — from AI systems and APIs to complex cloud-native infrastructures.

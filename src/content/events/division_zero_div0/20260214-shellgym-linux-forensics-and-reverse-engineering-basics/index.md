**TRAINER**
**KK Tan — Founder, counterShell**
As a mid-careerist convert to cybersecurity, **Tan KK** picked up his practical skills through getting OSCP certified and by participating in a variety of CTFs. In his career at CSIT, he performed a variety of red-teaming and vulnerability research roles and established the Cyber Training School at CSIT as the Lead Instructor. Besides the OSCP certification, KK is also OSCE and OSEE certified, and has a Bachelor's degree in Social Science (Psychology). He now sees psychology as a field of study where you fuzz humans until they produce unexpected behaviour.

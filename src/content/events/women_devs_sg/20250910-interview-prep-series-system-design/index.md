## Details

**🔥 Interview Prep Series: System Design**  
**📅 10 Sept 2025 (Wed) | 🕖 7–9 PM | 📍 Open Government Products**

✨ **Click here to register:** [https://forms.gle/6Wv1ZdSjc8wCHsBv6](https://forms.gle/6Wv1ZdSjc8wCHsBv6)

✨ **Disclaimer**  
We welcome everyone to our events. That being said, we always recommend any male attendees to bring a +1 female friend to join our events! So do share it with your female colleagues / friends!

✨**Synopsis**  
System design interviews don’t have to feel overwhelming. In this workshop, **speaker**, **solutions engineer lead**, and **WomenDevsSG director** [Victoria Lo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoria2666/overlay/about-this-profile/) will walk you through a practical framework that helps you structure your answers, communicate tradeoffs, and focus on what interviewers actually want to see.

Instead of memorizing patterns, you’ll learn a repeatable method you can apply to any problem. Together, we’ll use a case study to:  
✅ Break down requirements, entities, and APIs  
✅ Sketch a high-level architecture  
✅ Dive deep into critical design areas

You’ll also get **hands-on practice**: work through your own system design problem alongside other attendees, applying the framework in real time.

🎯 **For**: Engineers, job seekers, and professionals preparing for technical interviews who want to build confidence in tackling system design questions.

**🎲 Game Night with the ragTech Crew!**
Ready for an evening of laughter, strategy, and a little bit of techie chaos?

Join us for ragTech Game Night, where fun meets geek!

We’re bringing our very own Techie Taboo (ragTech Special!) — a hilarious spin on the classic party game Taboo, packed with tech terms and forbidden buzzwords. But that’s not all — dive into Code Names, Avalon, Tapple, Reversi, Bang!, and plenty more!

💡 Got a favorite board game? Bring it along! This night’s all about connecting over cards, boards, and banter.

Plus, you’ll get to meet the ragTech podcast trio — three techies who talk AI, code, and the future of tech every two weeks.
Learn more about them here: https://ragtechdev.com/

Expect fun, friendly competition, and a few surprise rounds that’ll test both your logic and your laughter muscles.

In celebration of International Women’s Month, Women Developers Singapore (WDS) is hosting our first-ever women-only **Recruitment Fair**, focused on supporting women at different stages of their careers - from fresh graduates to mid-career professionals, including new mothers and women re-entering the workforce.

Aligned with the International Women’s Day 2026 theme, **“Give to Gain,”** this event brings together employers, speakers, and community partners who believe that investing in women creates stronger, more inclusive workplaces for all.

Expect:

* Hiring booths from organisations committed to inclusive hiring
* Career talks, panels, and workshops
* Opportunities to connect directly with recruiters and hiring managers
* A supportive, community-driven environment to explore your next step

Whether you are actively job searching, considering a career pivot, or simply exploring what’s next, this fair is designed to meet you where you are.

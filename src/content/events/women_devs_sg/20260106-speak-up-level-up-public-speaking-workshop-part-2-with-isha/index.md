We’re back and so is Isha! ✨

After the last session (yes, including the iconic PechaKucha chaos 🤭), we’re leveling things up again for Part 2.

We’ll kick off with Isha sharing practical tips on how to structure your message, keep people engaged, and stay calm when the spotlight hits. 🌟

Then it’s your turn to take the stage:
🎤 You’ll get the chance to practice and receive real-time, supportive feedback by choosing to:

a) Deliver a prepared presentation on a topic of your choice, your work, a side project, a travel story… even bananas. 🍌

b) Showcase your skills PechaKucha style - 1 slide, 20 seconds, your time to shine. Guaranteed to bring not just chaos, but confidence, clarity, and quick thinking 🔥🔥

We’re also using this session to help more of our volunteers grow into stronger moderators and facilitators for future Women Devs SG events. 💛

Come ready to speak, learn, laugh, and grow, with Isha guiding us once again.

Let’s level up together!

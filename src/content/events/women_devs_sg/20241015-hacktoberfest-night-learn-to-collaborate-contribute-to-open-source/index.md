Ever thought about contributing to open source but didn’t know where to start? Or maybe you’ve heard of Hacktoberfest and wondered how to join in? This session is for you.

Join **WomenDevsSG** for an online event where we’ll break down what open source really means, debunk common myths, and show how anyone—not just experienced developers—can contribute meaningfully. Whether you’re into coding, documentation, design, or testing, there’s a place for you in open source.  
We’ll walk you through:

-   What open source is and how it impacts the tech world
-   What Hacktoberfest is all about and how to take part
-   Why contributing can boost your career and confidence
-   How to find beginner-friendly issues and make your first pull request
-   A look at WomenDevsSG’s own open source projects and how you can join in

You’ll also meet our community maintainers, see how we’ve set up our repositories for new contributors, and get practical tips on starting your first contribution during Hacktoberfest.

Whether you’ve never used GitHub before or you’ve been curious about contributing but weren’t sure where to begin, this is your chance to dive in with the support of a welcoming community.

**What you’ll need:**

-   A GitHub account (free to sign up!)
-   A curious mindset
-   Optional: Sign up for Hacktoberfest before the session so you can start earning your contributions right away.

**Call to Action:**  
Get inspired, sign up for Hacktoberfest, star and fork our repos, and make your first contribution with us! Let’s make open source less scary—and more empowering—together!

**Date:** October 15

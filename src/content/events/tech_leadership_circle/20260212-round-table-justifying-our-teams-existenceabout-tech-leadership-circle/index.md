​This round-table discussion will focus on two critical leadership skills: managing up (influencing and aligning with leaders above you) and clearly justifying your team’s existence by showing the measurable value you create. We’ll be sharing on practical techniques for concise, outcome-focused communication with leaders, introduce a simple ROI-style framework to quantify impact. We hope you will leave with concrete steps to increase visibility, secure resources, and make your team’s contribution unmistakable.

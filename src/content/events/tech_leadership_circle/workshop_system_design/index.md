title: "Workshop: System Design (Rescheduled)"
description: "​In this interactive workshop, participants will engage in a hands-on system design —an iterative and collaborative exercise that simulates real-world architectural problem solving. Working in small groups, participants will be presented with a system design challenge and work through the process of exploring trade-offs, identifying requirements, sketching high-level architectures, and refining their solutions."

**​Date:** Tue, 17 June 2025<br>
**Time:** 7pm to 9pm<br>
**Venue:** Open Government Products<br>
51 Bras Basah Rd, #04-08 Lazada One, Singapore 189554

​In this interactive workshop, participants will engage in a hands-on system design —an iterative and collaborative exercise that simulates real-world architectural problem solving. Working in small groups, participants will be presented with a system design challenge and work through the process of exploring trade-offs, identifying requirements, sketching high-level architectures, and refining their solutions.

​Whether you're a seasoned engineer or just getting into system design, this workshop emphasizes collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking under time-boxed constraints—mimicking the kind of decision-making common in production environments. Come ready to sketch, discuss, and design!

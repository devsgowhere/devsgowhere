​**Synopsis**
​**Session 1:** Shaping open data with [data.gov.sg](http://data.gov.sg/)
Speaker: Foong Yi Zhuan
​Learn the engineering, design and product decisions behind the national data sharing platforms, why businesses and researchers are leveraging open data, and how you can help to build the open data ecosystem in Singapore!
​**Session 2:** Experimental Learnings from Vibe Coding an Analytics Dashboard
Speaker: Cliff Chew

In this session, Cliff shares his recent experiment in building a live analytics dashboard using GenAI. He’ll walk through his vibe coding exploits, where he uses the public housing resale data from [data.gov.sg](http://data.gov.sg/) and converts it into a live, interactive dashboard. Cliff will dive into (1) what worked surprisingly well when using AI for creating different analytics dashboards, the situations where AI struggles in creating an analytics dashboard, and (3) key lessons learned from his GenAI dashboard experiments.

If you're curious about the feasibility of using GenAI to build production-grade dashboards, this session offers an honest and practical perspective.

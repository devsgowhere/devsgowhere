Hello, fellow Apple fans and devs!

As sakura petals drift through the breeze in Japan, here in sunny Singapore, our community is blooming too! 🌞🌸

Whether you're a regular at our meetups or it's your first time joining, this is your sign to come out of hibernation and reconnect with fellow iOS folks over good convos and even better vibes.

Event Details:

📅 Date: Thursday, 24 April 2025
🕒 Time: 6:30 PM - 9:00 PM
📍 Location: 71 Ayer Rajah Crescent, #02-01, Singapore 139951

Agenda:
6:15 PM: Food and Refreshments – Mingle and say hello to other iOS devs
7:00 PM: 🔮 Improve Your iOS Workflow with Cursor - Stefanie Seah
7:40 PM: 🈯️ Designing a Flexible Metrics Engine for Apps that Include Statistics - Romain
A lot of our users what to change something about their life. A great way to help them on their journey is to make them visualize progress. I usually include statistics in my apps to do just that. But I learned that -after the creative phase where we chaotically explore different ways of manipulating data- some order is necessary: keeping the metrics clean, composable and scalable. This way we can easily evolve the app and leverage data.
In this talk, I will share how you can Build a flexible, reusable system for calculating stats in your app—like averages, totals, and streaks—across any dimension of data grouping.

Romain (@RomainMakesApps) is an indie iOS app developer. He worked in small and big tech companies in both technical and non technical jobs. He’s passionate for Apple product design philosophy, Marketing, and Native iOS development.
8:20 PM: Free and easy

We may not have hanami picnics, but we might have snacks. Come hang out, blossom together, and let your Swift journey bloom 💬🌸✨
We’ll be sharing code, insights, and plenty of good energy – a perfect time to reunite with fellow iOS devs and light up the room with ideas (no lanterns needed!). 🛠️💡

Let's have a catch up with old friends, meet new ones, and share what you’ve been building lately (or just chill and soak in the techy sunshine ☀️).

See you there 🎉

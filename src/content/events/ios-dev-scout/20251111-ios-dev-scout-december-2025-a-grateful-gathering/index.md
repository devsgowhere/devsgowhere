As the year wraps up, let’s gather for one last iOS Dev Scout meetup for 2025 to celebrate code, community, and gratitude! 🍂✨

Join us for a Thanksgiving edition meetup, where we’ll share inspiring iOS talks, enjoy good food and even better company. Whether you’ve been part of our journey since the beginning or you’re joining for the first time, this is the perfect way to wrap up 2025 with your fellow iOS devs!

🗓 **Date & Time**: Tuesday, 11 November 2025  
🕒 **Time**: 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM  
📍 **Location**: Solaris, 1 Fusionopolis Walk, L5 South Tower, Singapore 138632

🎁 What’s cooking in Santa’s workshop:

-   6:00 PM: 🍕 Food, drinks & mingling with fellow iOS devs
-   7:00 PM: 🎤 10-min host intro & community updates
-   💡 2 jolly-good technical talks on Swift & iOS:
-   **Swift CLI Superpowers: Test your backend with Swift Argument Parser**  
    Go in-depth with the Swift Argument Parser library, showing how to create custom scripts for API calls, and database updates. Leave with ideas to automate repetitive tasks—perfect for boosting productivity, reducing bugs, and saving time!  
    **Brent Deverman**, Co-Founder, \[[StoryTime.my](http://StoryTime.my)\]([https://storytime.my/](https://storytime.my/))  
    Brent is an engineer who founded and exited a profitable two-sided marketplace in China. He has deep experience scaling products and leading engineering teams at CNN, managing eCommerce for DFS, and directing major cloud migration and web redesign projects at HSBC and AIA. Recently relocated to Singapore, he's now focused on generative AI applications and Swift development.
-   **Speed, Patience & Vibes: Building iOS Apps in Public as a Non-Technical Designer**  
    **Fiachra (Fiki) MacFadden**, Product Designer at Stealth Startup  
    By day, Fiachra MacFadden is a Product Designer at a stealth-mode startup, designing a suite of AI-powered property related applications. By night (and most weekends), he’s designing, developing and distributing Zhiyin, an iOS app that helps users learn Mandarin through music. Fiachra is a non-technical person, leveraging AI tools like Claude Code to build this application. He has built this app in public, filming videos every day on his progress and learnings. Currently, the app has 1,300 users on TestFlight. Fiachra hopes to launch it on the App Store in November.

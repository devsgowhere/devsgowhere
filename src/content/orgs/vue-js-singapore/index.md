FYI, from wikipedia... 

AngularJS is "... declarative programming to create user interfaces and connect software components, imperative programming to define app business logic."

VueJS  "...extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight..." 

ReactJS was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP.

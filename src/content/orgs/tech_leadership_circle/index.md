This is a support group for tech leads / engineering manager… or aspiring to be become one. Or curious about what it takes to manage and lead a software engineering team.

I hope this can be a resource and sharing group for first time TL/EM and also for the more experience folks to share some wisdom.

Essentially a tech leadership exchange:

1. You don't have to be a lead yet
2. Givers also receive, win win

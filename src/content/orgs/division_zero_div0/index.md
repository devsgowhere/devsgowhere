[Division Zero (Div0)](https://www.div0.sg/) is an open, inclusive, and completely volunteer-driven cybersecurity community. The mission of Div0 is to promote a vibrant cybersecurity community and safer cyberspace in Singapore. Div0 does so by providing a platform where cybersecurity professionals, practitioners, and enthusiasts can meet like-minded people, explore and learn with peers, and contribute to the community at large. Div0 activities include organising events, encouraging contributions and collaborations, and reaching out to the public.

We use this Meetup group to manage our membership and publish our events. It's free for all to join — just simply click on "Join this group", and you're in.
